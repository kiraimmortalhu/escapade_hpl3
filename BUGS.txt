ASSET ERRORS (needs reexport by Nate's process):

- They are all in the testmap
  - Piano has a faulty specmap and will need advice and fix
  - Wine pieces bottle cap stays in the air on all versions
  - Upscale drinks cabinet diffuse and spec

IN THE END
- go through all nrm and specmaps, port over heightmaps where missing and needed
- get rid of reflections where they do not fit
- Some assets like seethrough windows, ceiling windows are in wrong folders
Restructure these folders in the end and check integrity
