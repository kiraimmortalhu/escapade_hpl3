ASSET ERRORS (needs reexport by Nate's process):

- They are all in the testmap
X - roman_pillar_short

- Rat statue should have a fitting texture and good size
  - Neends to be reexported as a dae with the tail tucked to the side
- Piano has a faulty specmap and will need advice and fix
- Wine pieces bottle cap stays in the air on all versions
- Upscale drinks cabinet diffuse and spec

---- Imports

- Soma vegetation for greenhouse and red flower field underground

IN THE END
- go through all nrm and specmaps, port over heightmaps where missing and needed
- get rid of reflections where they do not fit
- Some assets like seethrough windows, ceiling windows are in wrong folders
Restructure these folders in the end and check integrity

---- Creating stuff

- Rat guard from rat entity that plays idle animation yet seems threatning
  - Occasionally screams out with script maybe if player is running

- Create Greenhouse structure outline

- AI for flora grunt
  - More basic creatures for the same AI if we can help itethrough for some reason
